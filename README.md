# IRC-Slack-Chat-Uniter
A bot that allows seamless chat between both an IRC channel and a Slack channel

This is mainly for stubbron teams where half want to chat on slack and the other half want to chat on irc :)

Edit settings.py with the appropriate details. You'll need an API token for the slack side of things

If you need help I can be found on irc.snoonet.org as 'Exoendo'
